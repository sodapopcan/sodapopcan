👋 Hello, I'm Andrew.

💻 I like to hack on Elixir, Ruby, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, shell scripting, and VimL.

🔍 I'm currently open to new opportunities.  I highly value participating in
collaborative environments.

🟩 My little green squares down there only represent my public contributions.

🥊 I am not, in fact, a boxer from an 80s video game.
